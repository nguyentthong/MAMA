**MAMA** (**M**eta-optimized **A**ngular **MA**rgin Contrastive Framework for Video-Language Representation Learning from Large Vision Language Model) is a novel approach to learn video-language representations from Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). We utilize LLaVA to augment training video-text data, and utilize an angular margin-based contrastive learning combined with meta-learning to optimize the effectiveness of the LLaVA-augmented data.

**Sample Generation:**

| Video | Generation |
| --------|-------------|

The resulting video-language model sets a new state-of-the-art on a number of popular video tasks!

## Introduction and installation

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MAMA</span> leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) as to automatically augment video-text training data, and uses these data to fine-tune strong video-language models.

See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) to install this code.

## MAMA

MAMA consists of a subtractive angular margin contrastive objective, powered by meta-learning to weigh the important of the training video-text data.
