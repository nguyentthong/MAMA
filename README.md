**MAMA** (**M**eta-optimized **A**ngular **MA**rgin Contrastive Framework for Video-Language Representation Learning from Large Vision Language Model) is a novel approach to learn video-language representations from Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). We utilize LLaVA to augment training video-text data, and utilize an angular margin-based contrastive learning combined with meta-learning to optimize the effectiveness of the LLaVA-augmented data.

**Sample Generation:**

| Video | Generation 1 | Generation 2 |
| --------|-------------|--------------|
| <img src="assets/football_video.gif" height=128> | The video captures a soccer game in progress, showing multiple players on the field, with the focus on the goalie and the soccer ball. | The video captures a soccer game in progress, with multiple shots of the players on the field, showcasing various moments of the match. |

[Try out](#mama-demo) our LVLM-based pipeline to generate text descriptions for your own videos!

The resulting video-language model sets a new state-of-the-art on a number of popular video tasks!

## Introduction and installation

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MAMA</span> leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) as to automatically augment video-text training data, and uses these data to fine-tune strong video-language models.

### Installation

Let's begin from creating and activating a Conda environment an virtual environment. Then install the requirements:
```
conda create --name mama_env python=3.9
conda activate mama_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## MAMA

MAMA consists of a subtractive angular margin contrastive objective, powered by meta-learning to weigh the important of the training video-text data.

### MAMA Demo

We provide some generated samples by our MAMAâ€™s LVLM-based video-text data generation pipeline:

|                    | <img src="assets/driving_video.gif" height=128> | <img src="assets/cooking_video.gif" height=128> | <img src="assets/machine_car_video.gif" height=128>
| :----------------: | :----------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| MAMA generation   |  The video captures the driver's actions and the car's movement in a dynamic and engaging manner, providing a comprehensive view of the driving experience.    |  The video shows a person preparing a meal in multiple steps, with various ingredients and utensils being used.  |  The video shows a step-by-step process of a car being built, starting with the initial design and ending with the final product.|

Run the MAMA demo using Colab (no GPU needed): [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PPeZSROlizqIwXX3eeDEhiOvPx820GbY) or

Since Colab free account offers very limited RAM, if you'd like to run the demo with a larger model, please run [./demo_mama.py](./demo_mama.py) locally. For more technical details, please refer to Section 3 in our paper.

```bash
# CPU mode
python demo_mama.py [--video-path $TEST_VIDEO]

# GPU mode
python demo_mama.py --cuda [--video-path $TEST_VIDEO]
```

## MAMAâ€™s Augmented Data

To facilitate future research, we release our augmented data based on the HowTo100M dataset at this link.
